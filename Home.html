            Australian archbishop rues legislation against confessional seal
            Editor's Note: Archbishop Timothy Constelloe of Perth has objected to new legislation in Western Australia that requires Catholic priests to disclose confessions of the sexual abuse of children. The new rule repeals the legal recognition of the confessional seal.

            The archbishop said that it was “particularly concerning and troubling” that the legislation was advanced, ignoring a committee recommendation that would have retained the protection of the seal of confession.

            Archbishop Costelloe also remarked that the legislation seemed to be based on a supposition that priests would do nothing when they heard of abuse in the confessional. In fact, he said, confessors would certainly urge the penitents to report the abuse, and any other suggestion is “either an ignorant or a deliberately misleading presentation of the way confession is practiced in the Catholic Church.”</p>

        <h5 class="text-light">Pope: “We are called to be the yeast that leavens the dough”</h5>
        <p class="bg-dark modal-dialog-scrollable text-light">Pope Francis hopes for a society and a planet where people are always on the move attending to the cries of others, changing course if needed and adapting themselves to situations for a better world and the common good.

            He evoked the image of this society in a message to participants in the 49th Social Week of Italian Catholics, which kicked off on Thursday in the coastal city of Taranto in southern Italy.  The theme of the October 21 to 24 event is, "The Planet We Hope For. Environment, Work, Future. Everything is connected."
            He spoke in an audience with the Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice Foundation’s annual convention, which was held at the Vatican Oct. 21-22.

            The foundation is named after the ninth encyclical by St. John Paul II, which addressed the social teaching of the Church, particularly in regard to workers and the economy, and the relationship of the state to society.

            “In every area today, we are more than ever obliged to bear witness to attention for others, to to go out of ourselves, to commit ourselves with gratuitousness to the development of a more just and equitable society, where selfishness and partisan interests do not prevail,” the pope said.

            “And at the same time we are called to watch over respect for the human person, his freedom, the protection of his inviolable dignity. Here is the mission to implement the social doctrine of the Church.”

            “In carrying on these values ​​and this lifestyle, we know we often go against the tide, but let us always remember: we are not alone. God has come close to us. Not in words, but with His presence: In Jesus, God became Incarnate," Francis said.

            The theme of the foundation’s conference this year is “Solidarity, cooperation and responsibility: the antidotes to combat injustices, inequalities and exclusion.”



            “These are important reflections, in a time in which uncertainty and instability mark the lives of so many people, and communities are aggravated by an economic system that continues to discard lives in the name of the god of money, fostering destructive attitudes towards the resources of the earth and fueling many forms of injustice,” the pope said.

            “As Christians we are called to a love without borders and without limits. We are called to be a sign and witness that it is possible to pass beyond the walls of selfishness and personal and national interest, beyond the power of money which often decides the destiny of peoples, beyond ideological divisions that foster hatred; beyond all historical and cultural barriers and, above all, beyond indifference,” he said.

            “It is therefore a great task to build a more united, just and equitable world. For believers, however, it is not simply a practical matter detached from doctrine. Indeed, it is the way to embody our faith, to praise the God who loves men and women, who loves life. Dear brothers and sisters, the good that you do for every person on earth brings joy to the heart of God in heaven,” Pope Francis said</p>

            Cardinal Eugene Tisserant was a librarian who knew more than 10 languages, advised multiple popes, and held key Vatican positions.

            He also deserves credit for helping multiple Jews escape persecution in Europe, Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, said on Thursday. The Jerusalem-based center will remember the cardinal and two of his collaborators as “Righteous Among the Nations” in a ceremony at a later date.

            Yad Vashem aims to educate about the Holocaust, its millions of victims, and its perpetrators. The center has recognized about 28,000 people from over 50 countries as “Righteous Among the Nations”, non-Jews who saved Jews during the Holocaust at great risk to themselves.

            In particular, Yad Vashem recounted Tisserant’s role in aiding Miron Lerner, who was born to Jewish immigrants in Paris in 1927 but orphaned in 1937 with his sister Rivka.


            In 1941 the siblings made their way to Italy with other Jewish refugees. Lerner found help from Father Pierre-Marie Benoît and others who were part of the Italian-Jewish rescue group Delasem, the Delegation for the Assistance of Jewish Immigrants. The priest and his collaborators worked from the Franciscan Capuchin monastery on Via Sicilia in Rome. Benoît is credited with helping save some 4,000 Jews and was honored by Yad Vashem in 1966.

            However, his work was exposed during the war and he was forced to flee from Rome, while Lerner took sanctuary in the monastery. After a different priest wrote to Tisserant about Lerner’s plight, the cardinal met with the young Jewish boy at his office outside the Vatican.

            When Lerner told the cardinal he was Jewish, the cardinal replied: “That is irrelevant. What can I do for you?”

            Tisserant connected Lerner to another clergyman who helped the boy find refuge with François De Vial, a French diplomat to the Holy See.

            Later, Tisserant smuggled Lerner to a small monastery in the Vatican. After a month’s time, in early 1944, the cardinal moved Lerner to a monastery near the Church of St. Louis of the French in Rome. Msgr. André Bouquin was rector of this monastery, where Lerner stayed until Rome was liberated in the summer of 1944. He would later recount that the clergy did not pressure him to convert, but “the nuns were unbearable.” Lerner was able to reunite with his sister in Paris.

            Yad Vashem declared both De Vial and Bouquin “Righteous Among the Gentiles” alongside Tisserant. But the cardinal’s heroics saved many more.



            Tisserant was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Nancy, in northeast France, in 1907 at the age of 23. He studied in Jerusalem and various French schools, becoming fluent in some 11 languages: not only Italian, German, and English but also Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Syrian, Assyrian, and Ethiopian, according to an October 1958 briefing from the National Catholic Welfare Conference News Service

            He served in the French Army in World War I. After a time of service in the Vatican Library as assistant librarian, curator, and prefect, Pius XI named him Secretary for the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and elevated him to cardinal in 1936, at the age of 52.

            Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, the then-Vatican Secretary of State who would become Pius XII, consecrated him as bishop that year. He would soon become president of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, a position he would hold for more than 30 years.


            Tisserant’s service at the Vatican included the period of the Second World War, when Jews suffered persecution under the Nazis and their allies across Europe.

            In 1939, racial laws enacted in Italy resulted in the firing of Guido Mendes, the head of a Jewish hospital in Rome. In response, Tisserant award Mendes a Medal of Honor from the Congregation of Eastern Churches, “in clear defiance of the government,” Yad Vashem said. The cardinal then worked to secure immigration certificates for Mendes and his family.

            The cardinal sought to secure a Brazilian visa for Rabbi Nathan Cassuto, and to this end he corresponded with Cardinal Luigi Maglione, Venerable Pius XII’s first Secretary of State.

            He helped the Jewish linguist and outspoken anti-fascist Giorgio Levi Della Vida move to the U.S., where spent the war as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

        <p class="text-body text-center"><h5>8 Inspiring Messages For The Christian Trying To Stay Strong In Faith</h5>
        <b class="text-light">1. God is with you, wherever you wander.</b>
        “Neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

        — Romans 8:39 (NIV)

        Sometimes we get caught up in our sin. We all have moments where our mistakes take control, where our hearts are weighed down with heaviness, when we feel so far away from God. But here’s the thing: God sees all of that. He sees our mess, our brokenness, our guilt. And He loves us anyway.

        There is nowhere we can go to hide from His love. There is no point in our lives where He sees us as undeserving or unworthy of love. There is nothing we can do to separate ourselves from Him.

        So even when you feel like you’ve gone so far from His grace, know that He hasn’t left your side. Know that all you need is to ask for forgiveness, to clean your heart, and to trust in Him to lead you out of temptation and back into healing and </p>

      <p> <b class="text-light">2.“I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”</b>


        — Philippians 4:13 (NIV)

        There will be moments when your faith falters, when you’re lonely or exhausted or just plain sad. There will be moments where grief grabs ahold of you and crumbles you to the ground, where all that you’ve believed feels empty, and when each breath feels like a chore. But in these moments, you will find redemption and power in His name. In these moments, if you choose to follow Him, He will guide you away from the heartbreak, the loneliness, the death, the loss, the toughest moments of your life, and back into His arms.


        God’s word and love will give you strength, even when you feel empty.

          So trust Him. Give Him control. Give Him your fears and anxieties and aches. Give Him all of you, and allow Him to work His beauty and grace into your life. Let Him remind you are—a child of God.</p>

      <p><b class="text-light"> 3. You are loved, even on your darkest days.</b>
        “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”

        — John 3:16 (NIV)

        God loves you so much. He loves you enough to give His Son for you, to watch His Son die for you, to put the sins of the world on His back for you. That is incredible love.

        Some days you may feel undeserving, blemished, bruised. But God doesn’t see you that way. He sees how you haven’t measured up, He sees the sin you carry and commit, but more importantly, He sees forgiveness. He sees you as His son or daughter. He sees you as His creation, and there is nothing you can do to remove that beautiful image from His mind.

        On your darkest days, remember that He is with you. Remember that He loves you. Remember that He will never forsake you.

          Remember that His Son died for you, and all you need to do is repent and believe in Jesus and the forgiveness of sins. Then be cleansed, renewed, replace dark with light, and start again in His name.</p>

        <p><b class="text-light">4. He will guide you out of temptation if you trust Him.</b>
        “You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.”

        — 1 John 4:4 (NIV)

            Temptation is all around us. It will knock at your door, it will bang on your window, it will try to sneak its way into your heart. But when you feel lost or that your faith is wavering, when you feel like your guard is slowly breaking down—pray, trust. Know that God is stronger than any temptation, and if you trust Him, he will rescue you.</p>


     <p><b class="text-light">  5. You serve an Almighty God.</b>
        “Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.”

        — Isaiah 40:28 (NIV)

        Our God is so big. He is bigger than any pain we may experience, any evil we may face, any hardship that tries to break us into little pieces. He is bigger than our fear or failure. He is bigger than any doubt.

         When you feel like your world is spinning out of control, when you’re unsure whether you have the strength to continue, remember that God has you in the palm of His hand. Wherever you go or whatever you do, He is with you. And that will never change.</p>

      <p><b class="text-light"> 6. You have not been abandoned.</b>
        “Love one another with brotherly affection. Out do one another in showing honor.”

        — Romans 12:10 (ESV)

        Not only is God always with you, but you are surrounded by a community of believers. There are so many people who care for you, who have good intentions with your heart, who long to protect and love and support you when you’re low. Reach out to these people. Be open to their help. Solicit advice and kindness when you need it. Build friendships. Open your heart.

        You were never meant to face this world alone.

          Talk to the people you sit by at church. Extend a helping hand to someone who’s struggling. Pray for a stranger, for a friend, for someone you’ve never met. Know that God intended His community to be here on earth and build those connections all around you. You are never alone.</p>

       <p> <b class="text-light">7. God sees the good you are doing..</b>
        “God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.”

        — Hebrews 6:10 (NIV)

        It can be so easy to fall into the trap of feeling not good enough. Whether it be a kindness gone unnoticed, a tired ache after a long day, feeling like you’re never measuring up, or that God doesn’t care—it happens to all of us. But often this is because we’re too focused on ourselves to see that God is blessing us in so many ways, and often in different ways than we expect.

           We should do always do good; not because we want it returned to us, but out of the kindness of our hearts. We should allow God’s love to fill us and shine through us. We shouldn’t be hoping for a reward. But we should also know that God does see the positive things we are doing; a good deed, in His eyes, doesn’t go unnoticed. He loves us and hasn’t forgotten us.</p>


      <p>  <b class="text-light">8. Your faith is more powerful than your fear.</b>
        “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”

        — John 14:27 (NIV)

        This world will give you so many unknowns—whether that’s career-wise, love/relationship-wise, health-wise, status-wise, or even where you call home. There are moments you can’t plan for, whether that has to do with your loved ones, your decisions, or how moments play out around you. In those moments you can fold, you can be anxious, you can live with regret or fear, or you can trust God.

        Let your faith in the Father be bigger than any fear.

        Even when times are tough, even when you’re unsure where to go, even when you’re filled with doubt, know that God has a plan. Know that God isn’t just going to leave you in the dust. This world might not always make sense, and your prayers might not be answered in the way you hope, but that doesn’t mean He’s ignoring you. Perhaps an unanswered prayer is a blessing you never know you needed. Perhaps a closed door is an opened one down the road. Perhaps the pain you’re feeling is a powerful lesson in strength. Perhaps you simply need a reminder that you serve an all-powerful God.</p>
